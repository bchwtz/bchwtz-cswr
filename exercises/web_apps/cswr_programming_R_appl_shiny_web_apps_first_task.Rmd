## Today's task

Remember our appointment from the 3rd of May 2022: 

**Aim**

We are interested in considering the overnight trips of a specific region in a specific state in Australia. Optionally, we want to select a specific purpose for the overnight trips, e.g. we are interested in the time-dependent visits of business people in Adelaide in South Australia.

On the one hand, we want to get and save the filtered data and on the other hand we want to visualize the resulting time series in a nice ggplot.
Furthermore, we are also interested in the total number of overnight trips for each region in a state like South Australia.

Today's aim is to implement our program from the mentioned appointment in form of a Shiny Web App based on the R package \texttt{shiny} (Chang et al. 2021).
\end{alertblock}

## First steps of creating a Shiny Web App

1. File $\rightarrow$ New File $\rightarrow$ Shiny Web App...

2. 

\begin{figure}

\caption{Creating a Shiny Web App.}
\end{figure}

$\rightarrow$ Either a **single** file named `app.R` **or two files** named `ui.R` and `server.R` respectively will be opened. A folder with the application name you tipped in will be created in which the app's file(s) is/are saved.

## ui and server

In both cases (`app.R` **or** `ui.R` and `server.R`): 

+ ui: user interface, where we can interact with the app by
selecting/typing in values/words, clicking on buttons, ticking a box and so on\newline
$\rightarrow$ Consequently, on the ui are different boxes, fields (where we can choose values) and panels (where plot(s), text, etc. will be shown).
    
+ server: we define how the different outputs (boxes, panels, text, tables, etc.) will be generated, when we interact with the ui e.g. by ticking a box


calling `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)` to create a Shiny app object

\begin{textblock}{11}(0.7,7)

Today's main references for constructing Shiny Web Apps: Take a look at the functions of \texttt{shiny} (Chang et al. 2021), at the Shiny Cheat Sheet (RStudio, Inc. 2015) and at the Shiny Gallery (RStudio, Inc. 2020).
\end{alertblock}
\end{textblock}

## Task - Sketch of Australian tourism Shiny Web App 


### Your turn

Make a sketch, how the Shiny Web App for the Australian tourism data should look like. How should the different elements of the ui interact with the server and vice versa?
