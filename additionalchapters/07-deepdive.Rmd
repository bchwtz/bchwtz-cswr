Debugging != Testing
## Functions are Objects

## Object Orientation in R: S3 and S4 Classes

## Recursion

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=NULL, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("gfx/CHAP-RecursiveRedundantClock.jpg")
```


**Tower of Hanoi**
A more advanced example that can be solved using a recursive algorithm is the childrens game "Tower of Hanoi".

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=NULL, out.width="70%"}
if (knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::include_graphics("gfx/gif/towerOfHanoi.gif")
}
```

The R Code for this puzzle game can be found in the repository at [github.com/yihui](https://github.com/yihui/fun/blob/master/R/tower_of_hanoi.R).
